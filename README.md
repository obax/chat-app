# Chat app

Created basic server using this guide: https://socket.io/get-started/chat

Now, to extend the proof of concept, I want to:
* create react app and use socket.io client there
* add basic functionality:
  * user is typing
  * timestamps
  * username (may require database for that, so...)
* deploy live frontend and backend
